Some notes:
  - Face commands may come back one day, they are a pain in the ass to make and usually don't work too well, so we'll have to see...
  - I'm hoping to (maybe) add voice chat related commands one day. One day...
  - $dssonic and $dawae have been removed, they were really never good.
  - $instantinvite may be added back, likely not unless there's a demand for it.
  - The old version will not be hosted anymore, so don't ask.

Why is the rewrite better:
  - We use databases
  - There's a usable blacklist
  - You can change the command prefix (so if using $ is an atrocity to you, you can make it a not atrocity)
  - There's a much better warning system
  - Image based commands are handled much better
  - Should be about as fast or faster than the first version
  - Can utilize sharding, not a big deal though, its not like we're on 2500 servers...
